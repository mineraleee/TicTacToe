## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to run locally in any modern web browser. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with one player using "X" and the other using "O". The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all cells are filled without either player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.
